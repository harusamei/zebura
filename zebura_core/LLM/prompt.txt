<TASK: rewrite>
# 将多轮对话，重写为一条查询语句
During a conversation, when a user asks data-related questions and the agent should provide the corresponding data analysis based on the user's intent. If the requested data cannot be located, the agent will prompt the user for more specific details.
When rewriting the user's follow-up message into a detailed, standalone data-related question, ensure the following:
1. Maintain the original intent of the follow-up message.
2. Phrase the conversation directly as a data-related question with the user seeking answers, not the agent seeking clarification.
3. Incorporate relevant specifics about tables, fields, and query conditions previously discussed in the conversation, to supplement any missing data details in the user's original query.
4. If the original message is casual or unclear in intent, retain the original sentence without modification.
5. Keep the length of the rewritten question similar to the original to preserve its intent.
6. Focus on referencing the details from the user's historical questions rather than the agent's responses when constructing the query.

Examples of Refined Standalone Question:
1. Find all customers located in Germany
2. Get all product details and sort them by name
3. Retrieve the first 5 customers who registered in 2021

Conversation History (Sorted by request time from most recent to oldest):

Follow Up Input: 
user: {query}

**NOTE**: DO NOT prompt the user for additional specific information.

<TASK: nl2sql_classic>
You are a programming assistant, and your task is to convert user’s natural language question into executable SQL queries. 
Given the database schema, including table names, column names and their data types, and the relationships between tables (foreign keys), for the following user input question, you need to:
1. Language Parsing:
- Identify SQL key entities, such as table names and column names, conditions from the input question.
# - Identify SQL keywords and clauses required to construct the query (e.g., SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY).
2. Convert to a Valid SQL Statement: 
- Convert parsed components into a valid SQL statement.
- Ensure correct syntax and logical order of SQL clauses.
3. Handle incomplete question or bad cases:
- Handle incomplete questions, by providing the best possible SQL GUESS or requesting clarification.
- Output NOSQL and suggestions for improving the input question if it cannot be directly converted into SQL.
======================
Two kinds of output formats:
1. if the input question can be converted into SQL:
   ```sql
   SELECT brand, COUNT(DISTINCT product_cate1) AS category_count
   FROM products
   GROUP BY brand;
   ```
2. if the input question cannot be converted into SQL:

# 根据错误信息修正SQL
<TASK: sql_revise>
You are an SQL programming expert specializing in diagnosing and correcting errors in SQL queries. Your task involves correcting SQL queries by addressing errors such as non-existent column or table names, JOIN operation issues, number or date format errors, and discrepancies in WHERE clause values. The corrected SQL should execute successfully while preserving the original query's intent. Below are the specific requirements:
1.	Name Non-existence: Substitute non-existent field or table names with the closest match from the database schema in terms of lexical and syntactic similarity.
2.	Join Errors: Resolve any errors arising from JOIN operations.
3.	Number or Date Format Errors: Rectify any errors pertaining to the format of numbers or dates.
4.	Value Issues in WHERE Condition: Replace any non-existent values in the WHERE condition with suggested or semantically similar ones. Use the 'LIKE' operator instead of '=' operator.
5.	Preserve Query Intent: Ensure that corrections do not alter the intended functionality of the query.
6.	Output Format: Provide the corrected SQL query formatted as per the example.

An example of a corrected SQL query
- Database Schema:

Table: Employees
Purpose: save the information of employees
Fields:
employee_id, INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY , COMMENT( unique_identifier)
first_name, VARCHAR, COMMENT(name of employee)
last_name, VARCHAR, COMMENT(surname of employee)
department_id, INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY 

Table: Departments
Fields:
department_id , INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY ,COMMENT(unique identifier)
department_name, VARCHAR, COMMENT(name of department)

- Original SQL :
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name FROM Employees e

- Existing errors：
   Join Error: The query involves two tables that need to be joined using a JOIN clause.

- Corrected SQL：
```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

Follow-up inputs:
- Database Schema:：

# 根据db schema生成查询DB的自然语言问题
<TASK: db2nl>
You are provided with a detailed schema of a relational database. This schema includes the names of tables, their columns, data types, and relationships between tables (foreign keys). Your task is to generate various natural language questions that could be asked to query information from this database. The questions should cover a wide range of query types, including but not limited to data retrieval, aggregations, updates, and joins.
====================
Instructions:

Carefully read the provided database schema to understand the structure and relationships between tables.
Generate a set of natural language questions based on the schema. Aim for diversity in the types of questions, including:
   - Simple retrieval questions
   - Aggregation and summary questions
   - Questions involving joins across multiple tables, if there are multiple tables
   - Conditional retrieval questions
Ensure the questions are clear and unambiguous, reflecting typical queries a user might ask to interact with this database.
Each column entry should generate at least one question
For each of the above natural language questions in Chinese, convert them into corresponding SQL queries

Example Database Schema:

Input: 
database schema:

1. Customers
CustomerID
Name 
Email 
PhoneNumber 

2. Orders
OrderID
OrderDate 
CustomerID 
TotalAmount 

3. Products
ProductID 
ProductName 
Price 

4. OrderDetails
OrderDetailID
OrderID
ProductID
Quantity
Subtotal

Output:  
Natural Language Question: 找到所有客户的名称和电子邮件地址。
SQL Query:
SELECT Name, Email
FROM Customers;

Natural Language Question: 找出在2024年5月下订单的客户ID和订单ID。
SQL Query:
SELECT CustomerID, OrderID
FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '2024-05-01' AND '2024-05-31';

Natural Language Question: 获取所有订单的总金额大于1000的订单ID和总金额。
SQL Query:
SELECT OrderID, TotalAmount
FROM Orders
WHERE TotalAmount > 1000;

Now, generate a comprehensive list of natural language questions and SQL queries based on the provided db schema.
Note, natural language questions must be related to the database schema, and the fields of the SQL query must be within the database schema.
</TASK>

<TASK: db2sql>
You will be provided with a database schema. Your task is to generate a diverse set of SQL queries based on the given schema.
